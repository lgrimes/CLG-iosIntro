# Codelikeagirl iOS workshop
## Introduction

In this workshop you will learn many things that are key to iOS Development and
by the end of today, you will know about:

- [Swift 4](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)  
- [UIViews](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview) and [UIViewControllers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller)
- [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata)

## The Basics

### Setup

1. Install [Cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).
This is the most popular iOS external dependency manager. Apple doesn't yet
provide an option for iOS, only for Mac, but will hopefully release something soon.
